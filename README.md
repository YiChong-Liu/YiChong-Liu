### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Yichong Liu, a future software engineer and a senior CS undergraduate student at UMass Amherst. I'm totally commited to enrich my tech stacks and develop better software-solutions to maintain competence in my role. My interests lie in software engineering (more prefer back-end), and machine learning. I've taken a wide range of CS courses related with programming, systems, ML and mathematics. In my spare time I also have interests in learning Mathematics and Economics. Feel free to check my repos here and reach out to me if you have any questions. Thanks!
